# vfastronauts

Your personalized, hands-on guide to learning Git and GitHub.

## What is this?

This is a README that corresponds to `vfastronauts`, a public GitHub ["repo"](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-repositories) that I created but that you can contribute to.

[README](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-readmes) = well, you should read it. Per Github, "You can add a README file to your repository to tell other people why your project is useful, what they can do with your project, and how they can use it."

## What you'll do

Before your first day at Astronomer, you'll be ahead if you can do the following:

1. [Clone a GitHub repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository) (aka download its contents to your "local machine", aka computer)
2. [Create a GitHub "Issue"](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-issues) (aka something you want to fix, edit, add, delete)
3. Create a branch (aka a copy of those same files)
4. Make a change to a file on your own branch (and save it, but without affecting the original file in the "master" branch)
5. [Submit a "Pull Request"](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) - aka push up that change for review by someone else
6. ["Merge" that change to "master"](aka publish it and port those changes back up to the original file)

## What you need

1. Your Terminal (this is an "app" that comes by default on your computer - look it up in Spotlight)
2. A Code Editor. Pick one of the two:
   - [Atom](https://atom.io/)
   - [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. A GitHub Account
   - [Create an account](https://github.com/join?source=header-home) (use your Astro email address)
4. Doritos with lime (*optional*)

## Where to start

Everything you need to do will be in the form of a GitHub issue. With your name on it.
